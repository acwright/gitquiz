Need help? Use the cheat sheets I gave you...

1. Change directory to your desktop.
2. Create a new project folder (not a rails project just an empty folder!) and call it whatever you want.
3. Change directory into the new folder.
4. Initialize a new git repository.
5. Using whatever editor you choose open the folder in your editor and create the following:
  - A file called README.md. Do not add any content to this file at the moment.
  - A folder called whatever you want containing a file named your_name.txt replacing your_name with your actual name duh. Make the content of this file any text you want.
6. Add the above files to the repository and create a commit using git.
7. Go to your github account and create a new repository. Name it the same as your project folder name.
8. Back in your terminal, add the newly created github repo as your local repositories remote origin. Hint: There is a line you can copy on your newly created repos page...
